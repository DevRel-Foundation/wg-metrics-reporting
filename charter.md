# DRAFT: Metrics, Reporting, and Best Practices Working Group Charter


The DRF Metrics, Reporting, and Best Practices Working Group charter is an operating document which defines and outlines the goals the WG aims to accomplish.



## 1. Working Group Definition
One of the many challenges the practice of DevRel faces is measuring success and demonstrating value. This working group is dedicated to providing guidance for DevRel practitioners to identify which metrics matter and how to gather and report those metrics, along with best practices for a successful DevRel program.

Our mission is to identify, evaluate, and share actionable strategies and best practices for determining, collecting, and reporting metrics that take into consideration the often unique goals of a DevRel program within the context of the company it represents and serves.   

The primary objectives of the Metrics, Reporting, and Best Practices WG include the following themes:
- Strategy Improvement:
    - Review models like: the Orbit Model, Marketing Funnel, AAARRRP Strategy Framework, Bowling Alley Framework, DQL.
    - Develop metrics strategies that align with organizational goals, including identifying leading vs. lagging indicators.
    - Develop tracking and metrics strategies, including the potential consequences and unintended behaviors of optimizing for specific metrics. 
    - Create maturity models to guide DevRel programs at different stages (startup vs. enterprise). 
- Regional Analysis:
    - Address regional engagement differences in DevRel strategies, with specific attention to geographical and cultural nuances.
- Customer Journey and Lifecycle Tracking:
    - Track the customer/partner journey from initial engagement to maturity ensuring continued support.
    - Analyze engagement models and frameworks for targeting different geographical regions.
    - Label and categorize DevRel verticals such as non-commercial, academia, for-profit, etc.
    - Track community-led contributions (e.g., open-source activity, peer-to-peer support) as indicators of program health.
    - Develop metrics for long-term developer success, such as retention rates, repeat participation, and career advancement within the community.
- Reporting:
    - Create an annual state report and best practices for measuring value.
    - Advocate for transparent reporting practices that balance internal goals with community trust.
- Funding and Metrics:
    - Develop sustainable funding models and metrics for segments without engagement data.
- Tooling:
    - Curate tools for metric collection (e.g., analytics platforms, surveys) and visualization (e.g., dashboards)
- Education and Advocacy:
    - Develop content to help practitioners to articulate DevRel ROI using metrics.
    - Foster cross-functional alignment with product, marketing, and leadership team to standardize metrics definitions and shared goals.
